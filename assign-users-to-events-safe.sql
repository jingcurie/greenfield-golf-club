-- 安全地为每个活动分配至少5个用户的SQL脚本
-- 避免重复报名错误

-- 1. 首先查看当前的活动和报名情况
SELECT 
  e.id,
  e.title,
  e.start_time,
  COUNT(er.id) as current_registrations
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN event_registrations er ON e.id = er.event_id
GROUP BY e.id, e.title, e.start_time
ORDER BY e.created_at DESC;

-- 2. 查看所有可用的用户
SELECT 
  id,
  full_name,
  email,
  membership_type,
  role
FROM user_profiles
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 3. 安全地分配用户（避免重复）
-- 这个脚本会检查现有报名，只为报名不足5人的活动添加用户

-- 4. 验证分配结果
SELECT

-- 5. 如果还有活动报名不足5人，可以手动添加
-- 查看哪些活动还需要更多用户
SELECT 
  e.id,
  e.title,
  COUNT(er.id) as current_count,

FROM events e
